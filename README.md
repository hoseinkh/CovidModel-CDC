The codes are for the paper titled ***Disease spread coupled with evolutionary social distancing dynamics can lead to growing oscillations***, accepted at 60<sup>th</sup> Conference on Decision and Control ([CDC](https://2021.ieeecdc.org/)).



The paper proposes a SEIR epidomological model coupled with a replicator-dynamics equation for modeling the pandemics.

The objective of this paper is to increase the capabilities of the traditional SEIR models so that they could capture multiple waves of the pandemic.
